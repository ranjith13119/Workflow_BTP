The process starts with the "customer person" that places an order using a Chatbot created with [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap/ranjith13119/smb-shopping-assistant/train).

"Shopping Cart employees" (i.e. Agent,courier, Rider) interact with the workflow tasks via a custom application (this repository) that consume the [Workflow APIs](https://help.sap.com/docs/r/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/df943e71122448caaf3c49f5ffd80627.html).
